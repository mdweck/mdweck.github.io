<p>          The company that I will be choosing is high end swiss watch company. The name of the company is Audemars Piguet. The company was founded in 1875 by two watchmakers. The two men that created the company were Jules-Louis Audemars, and Edward-Auguste Piguet; Hence the name Audemars Piguet. The Swiss company designs and manufactures highly complex mechanical,and automatic watches. I feel that the company doesn't do a  good job of relating to the average person   because they wouldn't buy these watches because there are only certain people that are buying these kinds of watches, regular people can’t justify a purchase like this.</p>
<br>
<p>The  brand is present in 88 countries.Audemars Piguet has been a manufacturer since 1875, making it one of the world's oldest watch manufacturers. The company is still owned by its founding families.
   The company is widely known throughout the world. The Audemars Piguet watch group is composed of 1,200 employees, 14 distribution subsidiaries, and 16 boutiques worldwide. It comprises three production sites which are Le Brassus, Le Locle and Meyrin in Switzerland. The company introduced many trends that are still followed today,which started with one of their most iconic models which are still popular today.

<p>The Royal Oak was characterized by a revolutionary design in the form of a rounded octagon. At the time, luxury watches on the market were all round, slim and in gold. The Royal Oak was the first high-end sports watch made of steel, recognizable by its octagon bezel with eight hexagon white gold screws. On 6 September 1651 Oliver Cromwell's troops pursued King Charles II, the future king of England, Scotland and Ireland. To escape them, he took refuge in the branches of an oak tree. The tree became the Royal Oak and a symbol of power and protection.</p>
<br>
  Many famous celebrities and athletes have been seen publically wearing the watch including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Muhammad Ali. Like many other luxury watch brands, Audemars Piguet has a number of ambassadors, including Stanislas Wawrinka, Sachin Tendulkar, Michael Schumacher, Lionel Messi, Sébastien Buemi, LeBron James, Michelle Yeoh, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams and many other personalities and athletes. In 2010, soccer player Lionel Messi became AP's ambassador.The brand created the limited edition Royal Oak Leo Messi.The collection was limited to 1,000 pieces and was outfitted with an alligator skin strap. In May 2014, Leo Messi visited the Audemars Piguet factory in Le Brassus to see where his watch was made. Audemars Piguet has made a number of special and limited edition watches for celebrities and athletes. They include Stanislas Wawrinka, Sachin Tendulkar, Rubens Barrichello, Jarno Trulli, Quincy Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sébastien Buemi, Shaquille O'Neal, Lionel Messi, LeBron James, Rory McIlroy and Jay-Z. In 2005, Jay Z partnered with Audemars Piguet to create the Royal Oak Offshore Jay Z 10th Anniversary, featuring a collection of 100 timepieces to celebrate the hip hop singer's 10th anniversary in the music business. For the occasion, watches were sold with an iPod featuring songs by the artist. Jay Z ft. Beyoncé also mentioned Audemars Piguet in her song featuring Jay Z called "Upgrade U". In 2014, the company established a partnership with the basketball team Atlanta Hawks. Many say that the highly-coveted Lebron James Royal Oak Offshore was the best collaborated watch company had made in years.
